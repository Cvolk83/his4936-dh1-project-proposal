### To Complete the Assignment

Have your group leader fork this repository. Then, submit your work to your
group 'leader' (at least temporarily leader anyway), who should make the
changes on their local repository.

The group leader should then make sure to commit these changes to their local
repository and then sync the changes to their repository on GitHub.com. You
may make as many commits and syncs as you want. Finally, to submit, your group
leader should open a new pull request in which the master branch of my
repository is set as the base, and the group leader's repository is set as the
compare.

If you need help remembering how to create pull requests, see the readme from
the [last assignment here](https://github.com/usf-portal/his4936-source-analysis).
